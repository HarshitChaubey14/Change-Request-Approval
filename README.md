Change Request Approval (CRA) is a project, where user can login and initiate a Request for New Project which he thinks might be useful for the organisation. Also, user can Approve the request which has come to him by other user.

So basically, there are 2 core functionalities of this project i.e. 
1.	To Initiate a Request for New Project
2.	To Approve the Request for New Project

There are 5 levels of Approvals- 
Initiator > Approvar BL1 > Approvar BL2 > IT Admin 2 >  IT Admin 1 > IT Admin 2

Starting from initiator, request will go to Approvar BL1.
From Approvar BL1 to Approvar BL2.
From Approvar BL2 to IT Admin 2.
From IT Admin 2 to IT Admin 1. 
At last, From IT Admin 1 to again IT Admin 2. 
Then IT Admin 2 will do the final Approval and Project Request will be successful.
